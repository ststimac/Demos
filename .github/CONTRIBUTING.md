# Contributing to this demos

There are many ways you can contribute to this demos:

## Filling issues, fixing issues and improving the content
Some of these demos have been migrated from the old TestDrive website and might contain some bugs with some browsers or the code doesn't follow the latest standards. We've tried to do out best to prevent this but we all know things can happen. If you find a bug, open an issue. If you know how to fix it or improve a demo, do a Pull Request!
  
## Adding new demos
If you are interesting in contributing with an interoperable, open source demo, open an issue and we will see how we can do that!

If you want to collaborate just make sure your code passes the ESLint and JSCS rules we've set up!

# Using Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repo, please use a GitHub pull request. There are just a couple things to keep in mind:
- Make sure there is an issue open for your PR. If there isn't you can create one!
- The commit message should reference the issue and hopefully fix it (you can use "fixes #issueNumber" or "ref #issueNumber" if it doesn't fix it completely). 
- If you are modifying code, please add a description of what you did. If you are adding or modifying a feature add the links to the documentation to verify your changes are valid.
- Separate PR for separate issues. If you are updating several feature please do a PR for each one.

 Thank you for contributing!
